# Fiendsmith-Crystal-Beast-Notes written by Dreamist

Why You Should Try It?

Any two monsters on the field enable it. Any two at all.
Easy access to other (still good) generic Rank 6 options.
Flexible lines which flow quite well with other engines we use.
Much of the engine is easily recycle-able.
The engine size can be scaled up/down for budget/space/needs.
When playing the full engine, one Fiendsmith Engraver in hand can get you to an anti-Nibiru negate within 4 summons.
When playing a smaller engine, the flexibility still allows for making strong endboard pieces and forcing your opponent into spending resources before your follow up plays.
You can still get a Rank 6 and/or an untargetable double-negate.
See the various engine sizes below.

The Minimum

1 Fiendsmith Engraver (Main Deck)
Rank 6 LIGHT Fiend.
Revives itself by recycling other LIGHT Fiends.
Monster removal effect.

1 Moon of the Closed Sky
Link enabler, can link right into Requiem.

1 Fiendsmith's Requiem
Link-1 for the engine.
Tributes self to summon Engraver.
Equips itself to Engraver for removal, or for Princess.

1 Necroquip Princess
Easy (and cheap) Level 6 body, with a draw effect.
Considering the high price tag of Fiendsmith Engraver, this is the "budget" option to try the engine in the TCG. But in some builds, it might also be the best amount.

The footprint here is 1 monster in Main Deck, and 3 in the Extra Deck.
When played like this, Fiendsmith Engraver is actually a brick. You can summon it from the hand with Requiem, but it won't be doing anything useful in your hand.
To start the engine's plays, you can put any two bodies on board. The most classic choice is to normal Summon Pegasus, place Zenith, and banish it to summon a second beast.
You may want to save this play if you have other special summons available first.

However you get there, start with these steps:

Link the two bodies into Moon of the Closed Sky.
Link Moon into Fiendsmith's Requiem.
Send Fiendsmith's Requiem to summon Engraver from hand or deck.
Activate Requiem's effect from grave, equipping it to Engraver.
Send Engraver to the grave to special summon Necroquip Princess from deck.
Shuffle back Moon of the Closed Sky as cost to summon Engraver back.
From this point, you can make a Rank 6.
The top recommendation would be D/D/D Wave High King Caesar.
It can potentially stop any Spell Speed 1&2 effect that special summons a monster.
So long as Nibiru is present in the format, you can make this to insulate your other plays.

Additional considerations include:

Constellar Ptolemy M7
If you add Tract and Lurrie, this lets you re-use a single copy of Engraver to search for Tract.
Including this may increase the reliability with which you can reach Fiendsmith's Desirae, mentioned in the next section.

Evolzar Lars
Targeted on-board negate option. Not as popular, but has seen play.

Wollow, Founder of the Drudge Dragons
Disruption tech, can shuffle back or steal from the opponent's grave. It's come up in conversation with other people on the server, but it hasn't showed up in anyone's lists yet.

A Bigger Engine

For an additional add-on to the minimum engine, you can also add two more extra deck monsters:
Fiendsmith's Sequence
Fiendsmith's Desirae

What these two monsters do is recycle back your LIGHT Fiends back into your Main/Extra Deck, in order to give you an untargetable monster, which can also negate the effects of two cards on the field at once.

This raises the footprint of the engine, but starting from Necroquip and Engraver on board, all you need is one more body:

Link again into Moon of the Closed Sky.
Link with extra body into Sequence.
Sequence effect, shuffle back Moon, Engraver, and Requiem, fuse into Desirae.
Optional: Link off or tribute Sequence for another play.
Activate Sequence from field or grave to equip to Desirae.
Alternatively, if you have Ptolemy M7 and Fabled Lurrie, and haven't drawn Tract yet, you don't need another body. Look in the Additional Notes for the line.

Full Engine (or close to it)
If you want to expand the engine further, these are the remaining (separate) main deck slots for the engine:

Fiendsmith Tract + Fabled Lurrie
These come as a pair, and are usable with 1 Engraver. Ptolemy M7 can help recycle, so you can search Tract.

1-2 additional copies of Engraver. ($$$)
More copies of Engraver can simplify plays, and make recycling much easier.
Having a full engine in this respect turns any Engraver in hand into a 1-card combo.
You can go Engraver discard -> Tract -> Lurrie -> Requiem -> Engraver from Deck, with just 3 summons. One more Engraver summon from grave, and then you can go into High Wave King Caesar.

Even without opening the Engraver or Tract, the strengths of the smaller engine become more flexible with more targets to search/shuffle during plays.
You may be less concerned about locking up one Engraver as a Rank 6 material when you can still continue plays with another one available for Sequence + Desirae.

Bodies & Other Engines
If you want some additional bodies for your link plays, before you use your Pegasus and Crystal spells, you can supplement with other engines. Ones that I've liked include:

Millenium Engine
Just a single copy each of Sengenjin, Golem, and Wedju Temple can provide the bodies you need for starting your link plays.
Golem is also a level 6, so you make a rank 6 with Necroquip, without using or locking up your single Engraver copy.

Horus
Each extra name is an option for a body in Link summoning.
If FS w/Caesar doesn't fit your build, Photon Lord might.

Snake-Eye
If you play a Crystal Beast Snake-Eye build, the Snake-Eye cards can often incorporate a link summon of Moon into their plays.

Yubel
Nightmare Throne can add & destroy Spirit of Yubel, summoning a Yubel from Deck.
Any additional body enables a Moon link summon, followed up by shuffling the Yubels back for a Phantom of Yubel.
Thus, you can run through your Fiendsmith Combo without concern for Nib or Bystials.

As an additional note here, whenever you have Necroquip Princess on board, you might be able to take additional advantage of her draw effect.
Whenever you send a monster from hand to grave as a cost for an activation, you can draw a card, and maintain advantage. Examples:

Engraver discard, searching Tract.
Sending Imsety to search King's Sarcophagus for the Horus engine.
Also, sending a monster to dump with King's Sarcophagus works.
Discarding any monster for Forbidden Droplet.
You might be able to get an extra card for practically free if sometimes you take a small moment, and check for effects you can activate before overlaying/linking away your Princess.

Additional Notes
Alternate Ptolemy + Tract + Lurrie line:

Begin from Necroquip Princess & Engraver on board.
Overlay for Ptolemy M7.
Detach Engraver, target Engraver to add to hand.
Discard Engraver to search Tract.
Activate Tract, search and discard Fabled Lurrie. Special Summon Lurrie.
Link Lurrie with Ptolemy for Fiendsmith Sequence.
Sequence shuffle back Lurrie, Engraver, and Requiem, summon Desirae.

Optional: Link off or tribute Sequnce for another play.
Activate Sequence to equip it to Desirae.

More funky techs:

If your build doesn't ever use its regular normal summon, Fiendsmith's Tract can search Majesty's Fiend, which stops all monster effect activations.
This has seen play in Horus stun builds elsewhere.

Downsides:

The footprint can be a bit big. The more you include, the more flexible your plays are.
Even if all you need is High Wave King Caesar, that's 4 slots in extra deck.
Forgoing Necroquip with a second Engraver will be more expensive.
Bystials have been on the rise since the engine has picked up in play.
Other decks which come prepared for something like Fiendsmith Yubel/Snake-Eye will also have disruptive answers for your deck playing this engine.

Explorations TBD:

Aerial Eater
Fiendsmith's Lacrima is no longer with us, but Sequence can shuffle back two Light Fiends instead for an Aerial Eater, which can then dump any Fiend.
Additionally, it can revive itself by banishing 2 Level 6+ Fiends from your grave. (Perhaps, Necroquip and Engraver.)
Unlike Lacrimosa, it's not a LIGHT Fiend, so it likely won't also be useful fusion material itself. But it is also a Level 6 monster, maybe useful for XYZ plays.

At time of writing, Lacrima the Scarlet Shadow (LSS) is on its way in Rage of the Abyss.
As another Fiendsmith card, it's likely to change the available lines:

From Moon into Requiem, Requiem can summon it too.
LSS can then dump Engraver, Engraver can shuffle back Moon to summon itself, and you can link into Sequence.
Enough bodies will be present in the grave for Desirae here.
In discussion with another experienced player, the viability of Fiendsmith's Sanct is likely to go up.
Maybe even with a single Engraver and no Lurrie.
